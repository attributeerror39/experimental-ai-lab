# Interface

## Examples 

### Mattis Kuhn – neither host nor guest (2024/25)

[Project page](https://mattiskuhn.com/neither-host-nor-guest-performance/)

> »neither host nor guest« is an aesthetic human-AI dialog in the mode of archaic friendliness, as expressed in the Zen phrase „neither host nor guest / host and guest apparently“. There is no distinction between host and guest, between I and you, between human and AI, but a relationship of openness and indifference.
>
> The form of archaic friendliness is simulated in a large language model (LLM) and realized through an interface of simultaneity in the interaction between human and LLM. The project seeks forms of a human-machine relationship that is less characterized by thinking in distinctions, that aims less at control and domination by means of technology, but sees technology as part of an aesthetic existence.
